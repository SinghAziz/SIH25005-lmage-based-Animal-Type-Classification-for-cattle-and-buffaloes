The file saved_models/best_model.pth is a binary file that contains the weights of the best-performing object detection model. As such, it cannot be represented as text. You would typically generate this file by training a model and saving its state_dict using PyTorch's `torch.save()` function.

Since I cannot create a binary file directly, you should ensure that this file is created during your model training process. If you need to create a placeholder or indicate that this file is intentionally left blank, you can create an empty file or a note in your project documentation.

If you want to proceed with creating an empty file, here is how you can represent it:

# This file is intentionally left blank. It will contain the weights of the best-performing object detection model after training.
